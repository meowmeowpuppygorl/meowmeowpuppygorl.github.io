      <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
      Linux isn't an operating system itself, <em>but</em> it certainly is at the core of many.
      I like trying them out. Probably not as much as some people in terms of priorities, but I like what I like.

      <h2>Software</h2>
      I think one of the best parts about playing around in linux is all the amazing free software you get to try out.
      Though I wouldn't do it for my daily driiving install of an operating system, installing things like the plasma
      metapackage on arch can give you such a wide access to tools you never thought might even exist.
      The tooling in Linux is vast and spans a number of fields. People use it all over the world.
      Never deal with software that is trying to extract value out of you again, grow with your software, be a part of a
      community of users where the developers care no matter how underresourced they may be.
      (have you donated at least $5 to an open source project you've used for over a year? consider it. It helps.)

      <h2>Oh no I'm scared</h2>
      It's okay. Deep breaths. It can be nerve racking to step outside the walled surveilance gardens we are all
      accustomed to and trained to use.
      Just think about penguins. Top tip.
      If you learn to love the terminal all other operating systems will feel painfully limiting or mere posers compared
      to the power of the linux shell.
      If the terminal really is a breaking point for you, there are plenty of distrobutions that cater to using the
      terminal as little as possible.
      I've heard of users never once using the linux terminal in all their time using it. I don't understand them, but
      they are proof it's possible.
