      <h2>Binding of Isaac</h2>
      Probably still to this day the game I have the most number of hours in.
      I've got a long history with this game, and picking it back up is pretty much always possible.
      Haven't played it in a minute admitedly--perhaps I actually burned out trying to go for dead god on Repentance.

      <h2>Baulder's Gate 3</h2>
      talk about a game declared an all time classic at launch.
      Honestly the only game I can compare it to in terms of how much people were singing it's praises for as long as
      they were is Skyrim.
