      <h2>Kill your gays?</h2>
      One thought that will not escape me after my hundreds of hours playing this game is how close Astarion and
      Karlach's respective stories come to "killing your gays."

      I don't think its too controversial to assert that Astarion and Karlach are the two most heavily queer coded
      characters in our journey, and they are the only two character's whose happiest endings entail leaving the public
      eye to a life of shadows be they litteral or those of Avernus.

      But I still love their stories. I do find myself wishing they were given better every single time I play though.
