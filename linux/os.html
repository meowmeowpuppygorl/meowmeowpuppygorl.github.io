      <h2>Arch</h2>
      If you're serious about wanting to learn linux then Arch is the distro for you.
      It has a <em>very</em> steep learning curve at first, but if you stick with it for a year,
      you will understand all modern operating systems on a far deeper level.

      Personally, I have also had the best user experience with Arch by far compared to other distros
      in large part thanks to the huge amount of packages offered in the AUR.

      Once you've grown accustomed to arch, all other operating systems feel subpar at least as far as daily drivers are
      concerned.

      Plus, you have access to the Arch Wiki, which to anyone who has been forced to try and scrub for answers on
      Microsoft forums is an incredible change of pace.

      The arch forms can be a slightly prickly place and the replies can be rather curt compared to forms with
      professional staff there to help.
      Many of the replies you get on the forms when people tell you impatiently to read the wiki, it is because you are
      probably being replied to by the person who wrote the wiki article after experienceing exactly what you're dealing
      with.

      <h2>NixOS</h2>
      NixOS was an incredible journey for me to go on, and I'm quite glad I did. As futuristic a distro this one may
      seem, it is actually slightly older than Ubuntu!
      Nix definately has staying power with me, specifically as far as server operating systems are concerned.
      The Nix package system is very unique when it comes to linux distros, as it is declarative rather than imperitive.

      If you don't know what that distinction means, you've probably only ever seen/used imperitive package management
      in the past, such as downloading and running executables, or even instlaling from a command line,
      imperitive simply means you install packages as you see fit from various binaries that you download from wherever
      on the internet and tell your operating system to trust them.
      Declarative package management on the other hand means that there is essentially a roster of software you have
      said will be installed on your given machine, and the package manager builds your system based on those
      instructions.

      This definately is a very different work flow than you are probably used to and will have it's fair share of
      quirks in operation, however, there are unmistakable benefits to operating in this declarative fashion.
