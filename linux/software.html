      <h2>Yazi</h2>
      Blazing fast file manager built with Rust. This terminal based file manager has quickly replaced every single time
      I use a GUI file manager--even on windows.
      Never again feel limitted by your file explorer somehow taking as much time to load a directory as it takes to
      load web content from servers half way across the world.

      Plus, it's logo is a cute duck, what more is there to want?

      <h2>Hyprland</h2>
      My first and favorite tiling window manager. I admitedtly haven't treid many others, mostly because I've been so
      enamored with the workflow it's enabled I haven't even wanted to try anything else.
      I always mistook the seeming fanatacsism for tiling window managers in the linux community with the zealotry for
      the gnu philosophy of doing your one thing well.
      While I can't argue that philosophical stance isn't at the core of what makes the tiling window manager a
      phenomenal experience, I really think getting to use one is the best way to understand.

      I loathe having to use a full (bloated) desktop environment these days, they feel clunky, slow, and cumbersome. If
      you care about being able to customize your experience, a tiling window manager like hyprland is an amazing option

      <h2>Yolk</h2>
      This is a templated dotfile manager that is simlar to other projects like chezmoi that try to solve the eternal
      dotfile management crisis of "what if I want my configuration between two computers to be 99% the same and keep
      them in sync while maintaining that 1% of difference."
      The issue may seem straightforward when you first encounter it. I tried using chezmoi and a couple other tools but
      disliked the added complexity from my previous technique soley based in GNU stow.

      What I love about Yolk is that it still essentially is doing symlink management akin to stow, but with an extra
      layer of templating to catch that 1% of difference via context awareness.
