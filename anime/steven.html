      <h2>Steven and the Stevens</h2>
      They're gonna make you smile. It's funny how much I couldn't stand steven the first time I watched the show
      through.
      The eyes I was watching through were still tainted, still simply the attempted perception of those who would hold
      attatchment over me and call it love.
      The eyes that precieve my every act as if being observed by an outsider, they having shoved their own site in
      place of my own.

      It helped me learn to love myself
      to trust myself.
      to know where I was going and what I wanted to be.

      It sounds trite and yet that was my experience with the show.
