      <h2>Let me borrow a slice of your life</h2>
      I can't tell you how much I pretended and dissociated into an existence within their world.
      I felt far more shame in watching it than I ever felt from engaging with any sort of pornography.
      The pornography was transgressive in a way that was expected of me, but to just want to gab about which end to eat
      a chocolate crossoaint from or whatever seemingly frivilous thing that show would contrive to talk about was
      transgressive in a way that wasn't to even be acknowledged.
